Heather Technologies
=====================

The ``tm_solarshift.models`` provides classes to simulate five different heater technologies:

* **Resistive heaters** through ``ResistiveSingle()`` (the default).
* **Heat pumps**  using the ``HeatPump()``.
* **Gas heater instantaneous**  using the ``GasHeaterInstantaneous`` and **with storage** using ``GasHeaterStorage``.
* **Solar thermal** collectors using the ``SolarThermalElecAuxiliary``.


DEWH Models
----------------

*tm_solarshift* is designed to work with different heater technologies. The default heater is a hot water tank with an immersive resistive heater, represented by ``ResistiveSingle``.

Resistive heater
