Welcome to tm_solarshift documentation
=======================================

tm_solarshift is a package for thermal simulations of Domestic Electric Water Heating (DEWH) systems as part of the project Solarshift. It allows to generate profiles of hot water draw (HWD), controlled load (CL), use different weather data, and electricity consumption for a household, to run thermal simulations of hot water tanks and estimate their thermal capacity, performance, and its utilization as thermal energy storage.

The repository was created as part of Solarshift project (RACE for 2030) developed in UNSW during 2023/24.

Go to the :doc:`overview` to see how to install it and the simplest usage.
