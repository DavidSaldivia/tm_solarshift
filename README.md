# tm_solarshift

A package for thermal simulation of Domestic Electric Water Heating (DEWH) systems. It allows to generate profiles of hot water draw (HWD), controlled load (CL), weather, and electricity consumption for a household in order to estimate 

## Installation
This is a project still under development, and therefore is still not possible to install it through pip. Then, to run the code I recommend to download the repository on your local computer, create a virtual environment to install the requirements (poetry is used in this project) and run the scripts.

In addition to these scripts, you'll need TRNSYS installed in your computer with a valid licence.
